# personalweb
Dita's personal web. Created so that those who know her know that she's alive, doing (not so) okay and useful (not really, dull) stuff.
She doesn't own the source code of course -- everybody knows her as a big fat bipolar liar and an underachiever -- Or does she? :))

I don't know what i am doing, really. 

Anyway..

What The MIT License does is: allowing you to do anything you want with MIT-licensed code, as long as you include the original license somewhere in your derivative.  That is, you'll probably have a COPYING or LICENSE file that says something like "[project] includes code from foobaz, which is licensed under the MIT license:" with the original license following.
